# Nadmin
Nadmin is an administration mod for the Steam game Garry's Mod. I have two inspirations for making this. One is from Evolve, it was a neat administration mod. I wanted to make my own with a few unique features, like including many mods in one. My other inspiration is that I love to develop things that way I know I can. I like to provide content that the Garry's Mod community will bennefit from, and I think this will help with managing servers. The name nAdmin comes from **N**ub's **admin**istration mod. I wanted to call it Nadmod (**N**ub's **ad**ministration **mod**), but that name is already taken by the Prop Protection addon [Nadmod](https://github.com/Nebual/NadmodPP), so I changed it.

***Nadmin is stable.***\

# Current additions that haven't been released
- Added rank access. Before, everything was based purely off immunity. Now, it first checks access, then immunity. Any owner rank will always be better than superadmin, etc. 
- Owners can change all ranks immunities. Before, owners couldn't set it above 100 or their own rank.
- On the scoreboard, avatar icon backgrounds are now the player's rank color. When you click on the name, their rank text is also colored.
- Made a new VGUI system. Began refactoring all of the UI. For whatever reason, I made some weird VGUI library instead of using traditional methods.
- Optimized the "Circular" HUD option. The number of faces on all circles was ridiculously high, now it shouldn't impact performance too much.
- Removed a few UI color presets because they didn't look very good.
