# Nadmin
Nadmin is an administration mod for the Steam game Garry's Mod. I have two inspirations for making this. One is from Evolve, it was a neat administration mod. I wanted to make my own with a few unique features, like including many mods in one. My other inspiration is that I love to develop things that way I know I can. I like to provide content that the Garry's Mod community will bennefit from, and I think this will help with managing servers. The name nAdmin comes from **N**ub's **admin**istration mod. I wanted to call it Nadmod (**N**ub's **ad**ministration **mod**), but that name is already taken by the Prop Protection addon *Nadmod*, so I changed it.

***Nadmin is stable.***\
