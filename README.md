# Nadmin
Nadmin is an administration mod for the Steam game Garry's Mod. I have two inspirations for making this. One is from Evolve, it was a neat administration mod. I wanted to make my own with a few unique features, like including many mods in one. My other inspiration is that I love to develop things that way I know I can. I like to provide content that the Garry's Mod community will bennefit from, and I think this will help with managing servers. The name nAdmin comes from **N**ub's **admin**istration mod. I wanted to call it Nadmod (**N**ub's **ad**ministration **mod**), but that name is already taken by the Prop Protection addon *Nadmod*, so I changed it.

***Nadmin is stable.***\

# Latest Additions (v3.6)
- Reworked Client Settings.
- New FPS Booster command.
- Added the Administrate command, which ghosts and gods you.
- If a server has a lot of members, you can go into the menu and switch to using a Compact Scoreboard, which really just moves the rank divider next to each player.

Compact: https://prnt.sc/1dkj6cd
- Started on a Profiles tab which will let you view and manage data of offline players.
- Started on a Sandbox section on the Server Settings tab. All you can currently change is a few convars with checkboxes on the left.
- Added a prop protection module that lets you manage friends and the server.
- Fixed the scoreboard throwing errors when a player disconnects while you have it open.
- Added `@` targeting ability. Look at a player and use `@` to target whoever you're looking at.
- Fixed the private message command.
- Brought back the customizable HUD.
- Brought back the leveling system, I want people to be able to restrict stuff by levels if they desire to do so.
- *Any more changes may be lost to time as I didn't update to this list in real time :^(*
